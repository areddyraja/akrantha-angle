                <h4>A recommedation</h4>
                <p>This report aims to present a study on how machine learning techniques can be
applied to such a requirement to recommend TV programs via distributed
learning system that uses Spark as its computation engine. A brief description of
machine learning models, their relevance and their components is discussed.
These techniques are connected with various paradigms of Recommendation
methods considering in detail the mathematical modelling for ALS formulation in
the context of TV programs. Also a brief outline of Apache Spark is included to
introduce the higher level API within the machine learning library.</p>

                <h4>Recommendations</h4>
                <p> movie rating prediction system
based on selected training sets provided by MovieLens.
Several machine learning related algorithms â€“ baseline
predictor, KNN, Stochastic Gradient Descent, SVD, SVD++,
asymmetric SVD, integrated model and NMTF are used to
predict the rating from particular users for unrated movies.
RMSE (Root-Mean-Square-Error) is applied as the main
criteria to evaluate their performance. The simulation result
shows distinct performance due to selected algorithms as
well as the corresponding learning rates</p>
